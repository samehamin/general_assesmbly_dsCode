Data Science Code challenge Solution
===================================

In this code challenge, i'm going to demonstrate the solution of two challenges


Part 1: Modeling
=================
A challenge to evaluate your ability to perform standard data science tasks in Python.

[My Solution] Twitter Sentiment Analysis, where i will create Data science project with the following steps

Given the dataset of VirginAirline tweets, i will do the following:
- Reading and exploring tweets.
- Clean the data and prepare it to the machine learning model training. (The pre-processing section).
- Exploring the tweets, common words, positive and negative words.
- Build a model that can detect the sentiment of a given tweet.
- Try more than machine learning model to check the best accuracy.
- Evaluate the model using different measurements (ie. recall, precision, fscore).
- List the pre-processing and post-processing techniques.
- Prepare a (5 minute) presentation or documentation for your work.


Part 2: Feedback
=================
A challenge to evaluate your ability to review & debug student code while providing them with relevant feedback.
